# Flight_Analysis
In this project, we aim to explore and analyze a dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that can inform decision-making. The dataset, stored in an Excel file named Flight_data.xlsx, contains a collection of variables and observations that will be used to develop and train machine learning models.

The primary objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and its underlying patterns and relationships. To achieve this, we will first explore the structure and content of the dataset, including the types of variables, data distributions, and relationships between variables. This will involve using various data visualization techniques, such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices, to identify trends and patterns in the data.

Once we have a good understanding of the dataset, we will proceed to clean, transform, and prepare the data for modeling. This will involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling/normalizing numerical variables. We will also extract relevant features from the data that can be used to improve model performance, including creating new variables, aggregating existing variables, and selecting the most informative features.


Through this project, we hope to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model that can make predictions or recommendations. We also aim to identify the most important variables and features that contribute to the model's performance, and demonstrate the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to a real-world problem. The skills and techniques developed in this project can be applied to a wide range of domains and industries, from business and finance to healthcare and education.
